# Rock, Paper, Scissors... Shoot!

A short game of rock, paper, scissors played in the browser console (will be moved to an on-page experience)
via JavaScript. Part of The Odin Project curriculum meant to introduce Javascript.

## Goal & Lessons Learned

This project was primarily done to teach me the foundations of JavaScript. Through it I learned how to work with functions to lessen repetition in my code. I learned how to work a JavaScript "for" loop that iterates on itself and keeps track of data values. I learned the importance of appended string and instructing the computer to select an array item at random.

Most importantly, I learned how to see a project from start to finish with planning, pseudo-code,
code restructuring, debugging, and code cleanup.

## Plans for Improvement

- Add a mechanism to allow the program to "sleep" or wait in-between rounds for the player to see the progress of the game.

- Move the game from the console to a an interactive webpage.
